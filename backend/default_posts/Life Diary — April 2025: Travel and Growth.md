## April 2025 — Travel and Growth

### April 5 — Qingming Holiday in Hangzhou

Took a three-day trip to Hangzhou over the Qingming holiday.

**Day 1**: West Lake. Walked the entire Su Causeway, took photos at Broken Bridge (no snow, though). Sipped Longjing tea by the lake at dusk and watched the sunset turn the water golden.

**Day 2**: Lingyin Temple + Feilai Peak. Went early — few people, very peaceful. Lit incense at the temple and made a wish (can't tell). Had Dongpo pork and xiaolongbao at Zhiweiguan for lunch.

**Day 3**: Strolled through Southern Song Imperial Street and Hefang Street. Bought a bag of West Lake lotus root powder and a box of osmanthus cake as souvenirs.

Hangzhou is perfect for taking things slow. Next time I want to visit during tea-picking season.

### April 13 — Latte Art: Failed

Bought a pour-over coffee kit and tried to learn latte art.

Grind beans → brew → froth milk → pour art. Everything was fine until the art part. It looks so easy in videos, but my hand trembled and ruined it every time. My first attempt looked like… a blob.

Drank four failed-art lattes and the caffeine kept me up until 2 AM.

Oh well — as long as it tastes good. I'll keep practicing the art.

### April 20 — 18 Kilometer Long Run

Half marathon training is in its critical phase. Ran 18 km today — my longest distance ever.

The first 12 km felt fine. Around km 13 my knee started aching. Adjusted my cadence and posture, which helped. The last 3 km were pure willpower.

Total time: 1 hour 52 minutes, average pace 6:13/km — better than expected. Got a full-body massage afterwards. The therapist said my calves are way too tight and I need to use a foam roller more.

### April 27 — Balcony Garden

Bought some plants at the flower market for the balcony:
- Mint — can pick leaves for tea
- Succulents (Sedum rubrotinctum) — pretty and low-maintenance
- Cherry tomatoes — apparently you can grow them on a balcony, so why not
- Jasmine — the whole apartment smells amazing when it blooms

Watered them, added base fertilizer, snapped a photo for social media. Caption: "Retirement starts early."

A friend commented: "Invite me over when the tomatoes are ready."
