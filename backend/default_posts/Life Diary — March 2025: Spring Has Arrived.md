## March 2025 — Spring Has Arrived

### March 2 — First 10K

Hit 10 kilometers today! Ran from home to the university district and back in 58 minutes. Not the fastest pace, but the point is I finished.

Around the 7 km mark I wanted to quit — my legs felt like lead. Gritted my teeth and kept going with my playlist blasting. Crossing my self-set finish line felt like a real achievement.

Stretched for 15 minutes afterwards, then grabbed an ice-cold sports drink from the convenience store. Standing on the sidewalk watching people pass by, I thought — life is good.

### March 9 — Weekend Japanese Curry

Learned to make Japanese curry rice. Used onions, carrots, potatoes, and chicken thigh, plus grated apple for sweetness.

Easier than expected: chop, sauté until soft, add water and simmer, drop in curry blocks and stir. The key is low heat to let the curry thicken.

Made way too much — ate it for three days straight. On the third day, topped it with cheese and baked it. A whole new flavor.

### March 16 — Live Music Night

Went to a livehouse to see an indie band perform. Small venue, about 200 people, stood in the third row.

The vocalist had a really distinctive voice, and the guitarist's solo was stunning. The entire crowd sang along during the encore — being surrounded by live music is incredibly healing.

My ears were still ringing on the walk home, but my mood was incredible. Decided to go to more live shows.

### March 23 — Cherry Blossom Season

The cherry blossoms in the park are in full bloom — a sea of pale pink and white. Brought my camera and tried dozens of angles. My favorite shot: backlit petals, translucent pink against a blue sky.

Sat under a cherry tree and read for an hour. A gentle breeze sent petals drifting onto the pages. This is what "peaceful days" must feel like.

### March 30 — Signed Up for a Half Marathon

Registered for the city half marathon in May! 21 kilometers — my longest run so far is only 12 km, so I have two months to prepare.

Training plan:
- Tuesday & Thursday: 5-8 km easy run
- Saturday: long run (add 1-2 km each week)
- Sunday: rest or light stretching

Nervous and excited.
