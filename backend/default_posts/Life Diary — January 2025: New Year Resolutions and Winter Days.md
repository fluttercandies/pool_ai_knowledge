## January 2025 — New Year Resolutions and Winter Days

### January 1 — New Year's Day

Happy New Year! Set a few goals for this year:
1. Run 3 times a week and complete a half marathon
2. Read 20 books (half technical, half non-technical)
3. Learn to cook 10 new dishes
4. Travel at least once a month

Slept in this morning, had hotpot with the family for lunch. Spent the afternoon reading on the balcony in the sunshine — started "The Courage to Be Disliked". Adler's concept of "separation of tasks" is really thought-provoking.

### January 12 — First Morning Run

Got up at 6:30 and ran 5 km in the park. The winter morning was bitterly cold, but after the run my whole body was warm and my mind felt sharp.

Route: home → riverside park → one loop along the river → home. Exactly 5 km. Surprised by how many elderly folks were already exercising at that hour.

Came home and made a steaming bowl of tomato egg noodles. Pure bliss.

### January 19 — Weekend at the Bookstore

Spent the afternoon at an indie bookstore downtown. Browsed for hours and bought three books:
- "One Hundred Years of Solitude" — a classic I've been meaning to read
- "Deep Work" by Cal Newport — focus methodology
- "Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat" — a book about the fundamentals of cooking

There was an orange tabby cat napping by the register. Petted it for ages.

### January 26 — Learning to Make Braised Pork Belly

Tried making braised pork belly (红烧肉) for the first time. Followed a video tutorial — caramelized sugar, seared the pork, added rice wine, star anise, and cinnamon, then simmered for ninety minutes.

The color turned out great, but it was a bit too salty. Next time I'll use half a spoon less soy sauce. Posted a photo and got 30+ likes — a friend commented "looks delicious just from the picture."

Watched "Up" in the evening. Even though I've seen it several times, the opening montage still makes me tear up.
