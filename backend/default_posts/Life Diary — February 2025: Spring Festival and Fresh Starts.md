## February 2025 — Spring Festival and Fresh Starts

### February 1 — New Year's Eve

Went back to my hometown for Chinese New Year. Mom started preparing the New Year's Eve dinner early in the morning. I spent the entire afternoon helping wrap dumplings — pork and cabbage filling. Grandma insisted on hiding a coin inside one dumpling — whoever finds it gets good luck for the year.

The dinner table was overflowing: braised fish, sweet and sour ribs, garlic shrimp, claypot rice with cured meats, dumplings… ate until I couldn't move. Watched the Spring Festival Gala until midnight and set off fireworks.

Dad found the coin dumpling. The whole family burst out laughing.

### February 8 — Last Day of Holiday, Museum Visit

On the last day off, visited the provincial museum. They had a special "Silk Road" exhibition — saw Tang dynasty tri-color camels and Persian silver coins.

Sat in the museum café and thought about how ancient people, without planes or internet, connected East and West through camels and horses. Remarkable.

Bought a Tang tri-color glazed fridge magnet as a souvenir.

### February 14 — Valentine's Day Candlelight Dinner

Prepared a candlelight dinner for my partner:
- Starter: Caesar salad
- Main: Pan-seared steak with black pepper sauce (second attempt — much better than the first)
- Dessert: Strawberry chocolate lava cake (semi-prepared, but I plated it with care)

Great atmosphere with a bottle of red wine. She said it was "better than a restaurant." I think she was being kind, but it still made my day.

### February 22 — Weekend Hiking

Hiked Baiyun Mountain with three friends. Took about 3 hours to reach the summit. Heavy fog at the top — felt like standing in the clouds.

After descending, we found a farmhouse restaurant at the base. Ordered bamboo tube rice, poached chicken, and stir-fried wild vegetables — everything tasted incredibly fresh.

Slept like a rock that night after all the exercise. Decided to hike at least once a month from now on.
